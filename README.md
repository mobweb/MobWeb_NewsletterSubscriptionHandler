# MobWeb_NewsletterSubscriptionHandler extension for Magento

A simple Magento extension that provides you with easy access to the "Newsletter Subscriber Added" event.

Please note that: This extension in itself does not provide ANY functionality, it is simply a wrapper that you can easily add your custom code to, for example to integrate Magento's newsletter with a third-party newsletter solution.

Also: This wrapper currently only handles the event of a new subscriber being added, and no unsubscriptions, since that is not required for the project that this is intended for.

## Installation

Install using [colinmollenhour/modman](https://github.com/colinmollenhour/modman/).

## Questions? Need help?

Most of my repositories posted here are projects created for customization requests for clients, so they probably aren't very well documented and the code isn't always 100% flexible. If you have a question or are confused about how something is supposed to work, feel free to get in touch and I'll try and help: [info@mobweb.ch](mailto:info@mobweb.ch).
